In your README.md, please add a short paragraph answering the question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related? (Answer this after doing the part below)

In graceful degradation we start with a max technology, we opt out for a code first approach and then we address the other lower priority issues. Web apps should generally employ graceful degradation because web apps are built upon websites. And, if a website works correctly, then a web app can work properly. In our lab, we first made sure that our webiste was working properly with the internet usage, this was done in Expose part. Then, in the explore part, we learned service worker where we can utilize the cache inside the browswer so that it can retrieve the data from the local browser and it can provide a limited functionallity without internet connection. In the end, we deployed a webapp.
